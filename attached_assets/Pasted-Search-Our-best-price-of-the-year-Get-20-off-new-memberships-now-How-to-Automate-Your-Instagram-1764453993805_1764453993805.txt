Introduction
This week, I wrote a simple program that takes some images and automatically uploads them one-by-one to an Instagram account.
If you are not too familiar with Python, I’d recommend starting with a basic version of the script that uploads a single image at a time. However, if you do have some experience with the language, I will walk you through the process of creating a script with a scheduler. We’ll explore how to leverage instagrapi, a fast and robust Python library for interacting with Instagram’s private API. We will be using replit.com, a free, cloud-based development platform, to host and run our script. This approach eliminates the need for local setup and allows your script to run continuously without relying on your personal computer.
By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a fully functional Instagram auto-posting script that you can customize and expand to suit your specific needs.
I created the images using Midjourney, a popular AI image generation tool, and saved them to a folder. The script, when executed, uploads each image from the folder to the account.
Setting Up the Environment
Before we dive into coding our script, we need to set up our development environment on replit.com. To do this, you’ll have to:
Create an account (the free tier will do for this project)
Create an account. You can sign up using your email, Google account, or GitHub account. Follow the prompts to complete your account creation.
Create a new Python Repl: Click on the “+” icon on the top right.
Select “Python” as your language, give your program a name, and click on the blue Create Repl button.
